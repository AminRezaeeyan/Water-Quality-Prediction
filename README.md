## Project Overview

Water quality is a critical issue worldwide, impacting human health and ecosystems. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict whether water is safe for consumption based on its physicochemical attributes. The dataset used includes various features such as pH, hardness, and dissolved solids, and the target variable is binary:

- **1**: Potable (safe to drink)
- **0**: Non-potable (unsafe to drink)
